    Sample script showing how to submit a prediction json file to the AWS bucket assigned to you for the challenge.
    Credentials are in your sign-up e-mail: please refer to the full project README for the exact format of the file
    and the naming convention you need to respect.

    Make sure to duplicate the .env.local file as an .env file in this folder, and fill it with the right values
    (or alternatively, set up the corresponding env variables).

    Required packages can be found in the requirements.txt file in this folder.
